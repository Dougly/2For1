# 2For1 (in development)

2for1 is a simple drinking game involving beating your oponents dice rolls... or drinking the current drink wager.

The game starts with one player rolling a single die and passing the die to the left. Every time the die is passed the number of drinks goes up by 1 and the next player attempts to roll higher than the previous roll and pass the die again.

example - player1 rolls a 2 to start the game and passes the die to the left. the score is now 2-for-1 meaning player2 needs to roll higher than a 2 or else drink 1 drink.

If the player rolls lower than the previous roll they have the option to add one die to their roll and double the current drink wager. If they do not want to add the die they must drink the current number of drinks.

example - The score is 2-for-1 and player2 rolls a 1. They decide to add a die so the drink wager multiplies by 2 and they get to roll the extra die and add it onto their score. The score is now 2-for-2. The player rolls a 3 to make their total roll 4 (1 + 3) and pass the dice onto player3 increasing the drink wager by 1. The score is now 4-for-3 and player3 gets 2 dice to roll higher than a 4. They have the option to add one die if they roll under a 4.

If the player's roll is equal to the previous roll it is an automatic loss and they must drink the current number of drinks.
